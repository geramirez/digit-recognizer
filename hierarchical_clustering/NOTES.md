I tried some hierarchical clustering, which failed because there were too many attributes. 

### Takeaways
- It looks like the pixels on the sides of the image are all empty also. 
- I still expect that many variables will essentially be the same, we could collect basic stats data for each like min, max, sd, kurtosis to try an analyze which ones are the same. 
- My pandas is very rusty.
